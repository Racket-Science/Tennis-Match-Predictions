    "#### Federer vs. Roddick\n",
    "* Federer dominated his rivalry with Roddick.\n",
    "* Roddick found the answers he was looking for on the court with Federer, but these moments were few and far between.\n",
    "* Most of Roddick's wins against Federer were upsets.\n",
    "* Andy Roddick found answers for Federer only in Masters 1000s events. Specifically,  in the 2003 Canada Masters, and in 2008 & 2012 Miami.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Federer vs. Murray\n",
    "* Federer and Murray have split their matchup wins throughout their careers.\n",
    "* While Murray did win a lot early meetings, Federer held most of the victories toward the end.\n",
    "* Most of Andy Murray's wins against Federer were upsets.\n",
    "* While Federer generally dominated Andy Murray at Major (Grand Slam) events, Andy Murray played past the pressure at lower tier events, especially in Masters 1000 tournaments.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Federer vs. Nadal\n",
    "* As spectacular as all of their matches were, Nadal generally dominated Federer throughout his career.\n",
    "* While Nadal did dominate the rivalry over the years, Federer has won the majority of their recent meetings.\n",
    "* Federer and Nadal both have a fair amount of upset wins between the two, but both players also beat each other quite a few as the favorite.\n",
    "* Nadal dominated the rivalry on the big stages like Grand Slam events and at Masters 1000s events, but Federer won most of their meetings at the season ending events.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Federer vs Djokovic\n",
    "* Federer and Djokovic have a pretty even amount of wins against each other.\n",
    "* While Federer dominated Djokovic early in the \"Djoker's\" career, Djokovic has been writing the pages for their meetings more often as of late.\n",
    "* Federer and Djokovic upset each other quite a bit.\n",
    "* Federer won the majority of their matchups at Masters 1000 events, but Djokovic wouldn't let victory go on the biggest of stages; Djokovic has grabbed the majority of their meetings at Majors.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these rivalries have been unique. While Federer dominated Roddick throughout his entire career, Nadal dominated Federer earlier on, and Federer has won most of their recent meetings. While Federer split wins evenly with Murray and Djokovic career-total wise, Federer dominated Murray at Grand Slam events while Djokovic took control of most of his Grand Slam meetings with Federer. Nadal, Djokovic and Murray did upset him quite a bit on their paths to world number 1, and the few times Roddick prevailed, they, too, were upsets."
