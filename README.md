##  About the Project

### Project Goals

Analyze data from 1999 to 2019 to:

1. Create machine-learning algorithm to predict the outcome of a tennis match between two players
 
2. Learn about what makes Roger Federer one of the top players for the last 20 years by looking at his top rivalries and their match data


### Project Description 

 Throughout the history of tennis, there have been matches and players who have captivated fans.  Using data from the last 20 years and modern machine learning algorithms, our team aims to predict the outcome of matches based on the playersâ€™ statistics and data of their professional matches.

### Initial Questions

- What aspects of the game drive the performance of the players?
- Do Federer's rivalries take a different story at Grand Slam events?
- Do higher ranked players win more?
- Does the court surface matter?

### Steps to Reproduce 

        1. Clone this repo.
        2. That should be all you need to do run the MVP Notebook!

### The Plan 
        - Planning
            - Create a Trello board
            - Creare chats on slack and discord for team engagement
            - Gain domain knowledge
        - Wrangle (Acquire and Prepare)
            - Create acquire.py and prepare.py with functions for data acquisition and preparation.
            - Split data for feature exploration and modeling
        - Explore
            - Ask initial questions of the data
            - Answer questions with visuals and statistics 
        - Model
            - For mvp (features: player_1_rank_points, player_1_hand_R, player_1_hand_L, surface_Clay)
            - Target : outcome (player 1 win/loss)
            - 3 best models
            - On best model provide visuals of how it preformed on the test sample

        - Deliver
            - README.md
            - *.py
            - Working report notebook
            - Slides presentation

## Conclusion:
* Rivals that won half or more meetings with Federer beat him at Grand Slam events
* The surface of the court affects the outcome of players performance
* Players performed differently based on the tourney level
* Higher ranked players win more often (about 64.28% of the time)
* Baseline beat our best model by 6%

## With more time...
- Create a model to predict if a player will reach the top 30 ranking by evaluating their first 50 games
- Filter for players that hit a max rank of 100 or better
- Aggregate full stats for Aces, Breakpoints, Double Faults, Wins, and First Serve Win by Match
- Aggregate career performance by court surface (hard, grass, clay, carpet)
- Aggregate first 50 matches statistics - later use to predict future ranking

#### Questions for our further exploration:
- Does a difference in career average break points won impact victory?
- Does a difference in career average break points saved impact victory?
- What characteristics and trends determine a player to become a top 30?
- Does surface performance predict a player's future rank?
- Does a difference in career percent-of-break-points-won impact victory?
