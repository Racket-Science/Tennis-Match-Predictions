# Tennis Match Prediction

##  About the Project

### Project Goals

    Our goal is to make a tennis match predictor that will take in two players and return the predicted winner. 

### Project Description 

 Throughout the history of tennis, there have been matches and players who have captivated fans.  Using data from the last 20 years and modern machine learning algorithms, our team aims to predict the outcome of matches based on the playersâ€™ statistics and data of their professional matches.

### Initial Questions

    I. Does a difference in career average break points saved impact victory?

    II. Does a difference in career average break points won impact victory?

    III. Does a difference in career percent-of-break-points-won impact victory?

    IV. Does a difference in average forehand winners impact victory?

    V. Does a difference in average backhand winners impact victory?

### Data Dictionary
    A list of the variables in the dataframe and their meaning. 

    | Variable       | Datatype| Description               |
    | -------------- | --------- |------------------------ |
    |                |           |                         | 
    |                |           |                         | 
    |                |           |                         | 
    |                |           |                         | 
    |                |           |                         | 
    |                |           |                         | 
    |                |           |                         | 
    |                |           |                         | 
  

### Steps to Reproduce 

        1. Clone this repo containing the Final_Report as well as the helper files.
        2. Create a .gitignore with .csv listed to prevent pushing any large CSVs to github. 
        3. That should be all you need to do run the Final_Report!

### The Plan 
        - Planning
            - Create a Trello board
            - Creare chats on slack and discord for team engagement
            - Gain domain knowledge
        - Wrangle (Acquire and Prepare)
            - Create wrangle.py with functions for aquiring and prepping the data
        - Explore
            - ask initial questions of the data
            - answer questions with visuals and statistics 
        - Model
            - for mvp (features: )
            - target : outcome (win/loss)
            - 3 best models
            - on best model provide visuals of how it preformed on the test sample

        - Refine (Report)
            - state what states and counties the homes are located in (fips)
            - project overview, goals, initial questions conclusion (did reach goal?, key findings, recommendations, and next steps)
            - Make sure markdown is clear on it's own.
            - Make sure all code is commented out. 

        - Deliver
            - README.md
            - Wrangle.py
            - working notebook(s)
            - report notebook
            - presentaion of report notebook
